## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Plain javascript for visual state of the notifications

### What I learned

Although this project was not too CSS-heavy, it was good for refreshing the basics of CSS. The real challenge was to change the state of the notifications on click. Since I didn't use any database for this project, I took advantage of the browser's local storage feature to permanently store notification states and, of course, learned the basics of local storage.

### Continued development

- CSS flex
- Javascript dom manipulation

### Useful resources
